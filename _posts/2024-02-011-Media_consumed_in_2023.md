I'm doing this post for 2 reason:
1. I want to share some of the media I consumed last year, just so people get to know me (and also perhaps so they get inspiration)
2. I want to be able to feed this into ChatGPT and make it better at recommending games to me üòÖ

Here is the link to my notion board with all of the media I've consumed in 2023:
[Alex's Consumed Media](https://wise-firewall-853.notion.site/1a58b3947fb1418cb642cee682e98699?v=9831140d78f94f4e83ee206b0d8a870f&pvs=4)

I hate to have to link out, but honestly I wanted an easy way to display a filterable table! I've added notes to many of the entries, just in case you wanted to know my thoughts on it. 

It took about a week to put this table together, so here are some things I learned while doing so:
1. Gaming Platforms don't give you an easy way to view your play activity
	1. **Nintendo** doesn't have any activity log of gameplay (they have a relative amount of time put into a game, but that's for your accounts entire lifetime)
	2. **Sony** will only let you view your play history on your console! So if you gave your console to your cousin, but wanted to see what games you played last year (like me), then tough luck I guess ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
		1. They *will* allow you to file a data subject request, so you can request all the data they have about you
2. Surprisingly there are few options for sites / services that allow you to track your gameplay
	1. I *have* found 2
		1. IGN Playlist: honestly not great and very buggy, **but** allows you to sync your steam library
		2. QuestLog: Looks a lot better, but doesn't let you track which games you **OWN** in a native way. You can create a new playlist called "Owned" or something, which basically serves that purpose
3. Almost all services are happy to give you an "End of the year wrap-up", but very few will allow you to view your consumption stats on-demand
	1. It's so dumb, like why not? You clearly already have this information. You're not the only one that can interpret it... Just let me see what I've consumed.
4. I've gotten **really** into comic books... like **REALLY**
5. I don't get out of my comfort zone too much with things I consume. I tend to gravitate towards things I know I'll like (I mean... everyone does this)
6. I'm subscribed to A LOT more podcasts than I thought I was 

Anyways, I hope you enjoy the list! I always welcome any comments, inquiries about the things already on the list, **OR** recommendations for new things.
