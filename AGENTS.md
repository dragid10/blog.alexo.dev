# agents.md

This file provides guidance for AI agents (Warp, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Primary Documentation

For complete development guidelines, architecture details, and common commands, refer to:

**[WARP.md](./WARP.md)**

The WARP.md file contains:
- Project overview and tech stack
- Common development commands (setup, dev server, builds)
- Architecture and code structure
- Content management workflow (TinaCMS → Jekyll → Static Site)
- Post creation and editing guidelines
- Environment variables and deployment information

## Quick Reference

### Start Development
```bash
yarn clean && yarn dev
```
Access the site at http://localhost:4000 and TinaCMS admin at http://localhost:4000/admin

### Build for Production
```bash
yarn build
```

### Key Architecture Points

**Content Flow:** TinaCMS (visual editor) → Markdown files in `_posts/` → Jekyll (static site generator) → `_site/` output

**Post Naming:** Posts MUST follow `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` format (auto-generated by TinaCMS)

**Key Files:**
- `_config.yml` - Jekyll configuration
- `tina/config.ts` - TinaCMS configuration
- `tina/collection/post.ts` - Post schema definition
- `tina/collection/author.ts` - Author schema definition

### Version Management
This project uses **asdf**. Always ensure correct versions:
```bash
asdf install  # Installs Ruby 3.1.3 and Node.js 20.10.0
```

## For AI Agents

When working in this repository:
1. **Always check WARP.md first** for detailed context
2. Follow Jekyll's post naming convention strictly
3. Respect the TinaCMS schema when modifying post structure
4. Use `yarn` (not `npm`) for Node.js package management
5. Use `bundle exec` prefix for Jekyll commands
6. Remember this is a Ruby + Node.js hybrid project (Jekyll + TinaCMS)
